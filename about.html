                Hello! My name is Tatiana, and I am the author of this blog page! I am a Junior at Michigan State University, and am 
                currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.A. in Information Science. After graduation I am hoping to become 
                a Full-Stack Software Developer. 
            </p>

                In my free time, I love to read, cook, play my switch, and hang out with my friends. Additionally, I am involved in 
                several organizations on campus:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>MSU Women In Computing</li>
                <li>Women In Engineering K-12 Outreach Office</li>
                <li>Phi Sigma Rho</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="bio-content">
                I love to travel; however, that is not quite as easy to do as my other interests. I have always wanted to explore new 
                places and experience new cultures. I hope to be able to travel a lot of the world in the future.
            </p>
