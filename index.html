                I have traveled to a lot of different places. More specifically, I have been to 9 different countries and 9 different states. 
                Out of all of those trips, I would have to say that one of my favorite places to visit was the Netherlands. I was approximately 
                11 years old, my parents rented a house-boat for us to use to travel through the country. Over the course of a week, I got to 
                explore a lot of different cities, both big and small. Through this, I was able to see and experience the cultural differences 
                between the different areas of the country.

                I loved seeing the historic architecture in the country. The buildings in Amsterdam were gorgeous, and being able to experience 
                the canals running through the town was amazing. Being able to bike through Amsterdam was very fun, and is a memory I will have 
                for a while. I remember going to the Anne Frank House, which was both heartbreaking and fascinating to see in person. I was 
                able to see the windmills in more rural parts of the country. I was also able to see the beautiful nature and rivers that 
                exist in the Netherlands, since we traveled to the different cities by boat, instead of using a more traditional travel method.

                Every year, Anita B org hosts the Grace Hopper Celebration, a conference meant to inspire women and strengthen connections 
                within women in working in technology. The conference was named after Rear Admiral Grace Hopper, who was one of the first 
                women to get a doctorate degree in Mathematics and helped create the first compiler for computer languages. She was also 
                the first female recipient of the National Medal of Technology in 1991. Needless to say, she is an inspiration to many 
                computer scientists today.

                Last month, I had the pleasure to be able to attend this conference in Orlando with 17 other members of the Women In 
                Computing club here on campus. It was a great experience, and I was able to make a lot of amazing memories and connections. 
                The conference had both informational sessions and a company expo. Through the informational sessions, I was able to learn 
                about interesting new technologies, such as Quantum Computing and Innersourcing. Through the expo, I was able to make 
                great connections with companies, and was able to receive lots of great offers for future opportunities. In addition, 
                there were a lot of evening activities sponsored by the companies attending the conference. One of my favorite evening 
                activities was being able to go to Harry Potter World at Universal after closing. I was lucky enough to go with some friends, 
                and we had a great time going on the rides and drinking butterbeer.

                Overall, attending this conference was an amazing experience and I hope to be able to attend again next year.
